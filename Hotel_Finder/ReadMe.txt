This is just a personal project. So the number of cities used in the first page is 6 but can be increased as and when required. In each city I have listed
the top 5 hotels, their distance(in miles) from a particular pickup point within the city and their per daily cost.

To build the frontend I have used HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Frontend JS.
In the backend I have used Django.
For the database I have used PostgreSQL.
To build the Maps, Navigation Services and to the 3D street view using the Maps JS API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Places API, Directions API.

I have even uploaded the tables containing the names of the cities and the hotel in all the cities in csv files

Hope you have a nice experience using my website.
